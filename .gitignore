**2. Reset Your Local Git Repository (A Fresh Start)**

Since your last commit was incorrect (it included `node_modules`), the cleanest way to fix this is to start over locally. **This will not delete your code.**

* Make sure you are in your project's root directory (`D:\Raghuram\College Work\Club\GDG`).
* Delete the hidden `.git` folder using the correct PowerShell command:

    ```powershell
    Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
    ```
* Now, re-initialize a fresh, clean Git repository:

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

**3. Connect, Pull, Add, Commit, and Push (The Correct Order)**

* **Connect to your GitHub repo:**
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/raghuram1015/sessionbooking-practice.git
    ```
* **Pull the changes from GitHub first.** This will download the `README.md` file and solve the "rejected" error.
    ```bash
    git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
    ```
* **Now, add your project files.** Because the `.gitignore` file exists, it will correctly skip the `node_modules` and `.env` files.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
* **Commit your code:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit of client and server applications"
    ```
* **Finally, push to GitHub!**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
